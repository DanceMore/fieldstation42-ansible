# fieldstation42-ansible

this is intended to be **my** personal installation on a specific piece of field-deployable hardware I own, not a Generic re-usable "Ansible Module".

it is also intended as an example to a friend of how one can rapidly use Ansible, even without managers signing off on infra-as-code being a requirement of the project.
